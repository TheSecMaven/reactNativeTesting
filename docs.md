# Hitachi Ops Center: Entity Relationship & API Mapping Guide

This document explains the logical relationships among Ops Center entities ‚Äî from servers to storage arrays ‚Äî and how to query each relationship through the **Admin API** and **Configuration Manager REST (CMREST)**.

Use it to quickly understand *what connects to what*, *which endpoints to call*, and *how to traverse a full server-to-LDEV topology.*

---

## üîç Core Concept

Ops Center models storage infrastructure as interconnected entities:

* **Servers** consume **LDEVs (Volumes)** presented through **Host Groups** on **Ports** of **Storage Systems (Arrays)**.
* **LDEVs** reside in **Pools** and **Parity Groups** that belong to a **Storage System**.
* **LU Paths (LUNs)** form the many-to-many join between Host Groups and LDEVs.

The diagram below shows both relationships and where to fetch each entity.

## How to Traverse Relationships

### From a Server

1. **List servers**

   ```bash
   GET /v1/compute/servers
   ```

2. **Get volumes attached to a server**

   ```bash
   GET /v1/compute/servers/attached-volumes/?q=serverId:{serverId}
   ```

   ‚Üí Returns `storageSystemId`, `volumeId`, `storagePortId`, `hostGroupId`, and `lun`.

3. **Query volumes and host groups**

   ```bash
   GET /v1/storage-systems/{sid}/volumes
   GET /v1/storage-systems/{sid}/host-groups
   GET /v1/storage-systems/{sid}/storage-ports
   ```

4. **(Optional) Deep lookup via CMREST**

   ```bash
   Search: lun, hostGroup, port, wwn, iscsi
   ```

   ‚Üí Retrieves detailed LU Path and initiator mappings.

---

## CLI Verification (CCI)

From a CCI Command Device host:

```bash
raidcom get port -key detail
raidcom get host_grp -port CL1-A
raidcom get lun -port CL1-A
raidcom get ldev -ldev_id 00:1234
```

Use these to validate the API data directly on the array.

## Summary

* **Admin API** = high-level operational model (servers ‚Üî arrays).
* **CMREST** = array-native model (LUNs, host groups, ports, initiators).
* **CCI** = on-array CLI for validation or automation.

Together, they form the full topology chain:

**Server ‚Üí Attached Volumes ‚Üí Host Groups ‚Üí Ports ‚Üí LDEVs ‚Üí Pools / Parity Groups ‚Üí Array.**
